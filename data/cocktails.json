The cocktail and soda should form a single stream of liquid falling into the glass.\n\nAs when pouring a Guinness, to achieve a perfect head on a Ramos Gin Fizz, the cocktail should be left to settle for at least a minute before topping off with what remains in the shaker. Ideally, during the settling period, the glass should be placed in a glass froster/fridge/freezer. As the final contents of the shaker are poured into the glass so the head should rise like a souffle.\n\nSome Ramos Gin Fizz recipes, and indeed Henry Charles Ramos' original recipe, call for old tom gin (also our preference), in which case you may need to reduce the amount of sugar syrup depending on your old tom, personal tastes and citrus fruit.",

This has a perfectly sized stainless steel cone mould and rod to make a hole for a thin sip straw. I use Berry's cone mould with a long stainless steel drinking straw instead of the supplied rod. Alternatively, use a pilsner glass as your ice cone mould.\n1. Stand a metal straw/rod/ chopstick in the centre of your cone mould. This will form the hole through which the straw will run.\n2. While holding the rod in place, pack the cone with finely shaved ice (snow ice). NOTE: Crushed ice is not fine enough.\n3. Place in a freezer for at least an hour, ideally overnight.\n4. Remove from freezer and leave to stand for a few minutes, then gently remove the rod and ice from the cone mould.\n5. If ready to serve your cocktail, place the ice cone in the serving glass with a straw inserted through the central hole. Or, wrap the ice cone in plastic and return it to the freezer for storage, ideally within a sealed plastic box to prevent contamination from odours.",

Then mix ingredients by pouring them from one tankard to the other. The foolhardy increase the distance between the tankards as they pour, thus creating a spectacular long blue flame between the two. Extinguish flame by covering flaming tankard with base of the other tankard, pour into glass and sweeten to taste by stirring in powdered sugar.\n\nWARNING - please practice with water first to perfect your method. Stand on a non-flammable floor and have suitable fire-fighting equipment nearby. The following recipe makes two drinks.\n",

Cut off both ends of the fruit and carefully remove the pulp to leave a barrel-shaped shell of skin. Place in the top of the glass. Wet the edge of the glass and exposed fruit shell with sugar syrup and dip in caster sugar to frost the edge of both peel and glass.

So if you use a slither of lemon skin on which to nestle a Werther's Original, don't express the lemon's oils over the drink. WARNING: Don't be tempted to use buttercup flowers as they are poisonous. They are also poisonous when eaten by livestock but their acrid taste and the blistering of the mouth they cause mean that animals don't tend to eat them. Interestingly, the toxins degrade when dried, so hay containing dried buttercups is safe for animals to eat.",
